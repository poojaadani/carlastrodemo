<p>Hover over each stage to find out more information.</p>
<p>Embedded above is a pure JavaScript-powered flowchart from a <a href="http://carlvlewis.net/dmchallenge">team project</a> that was part of Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism annual 24-hour digital media hackathon. The project took home first place at the end of the hackathon. I served as the team leader, divvying up content and slides to team members who later iFramed in their content under tight deadlines. I built this particular interactive in less than an hour from scratch using CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript elements.</p>
<p>I also oversaw the larger presentation, including customizing the open-source <a href="http://kevinbatdorf.github.io/codaslider/">Coda Slider jQuery</a> plugin to work within our project's constraints, and performing data analysis to ensure our team's conclusions were of statistical significance. Other team members who participated in the project included <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/stephanie-vatz/22/630/601" target="_blank">Stephanie Vatz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ranimolla" target="_blank">Rani Molla</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ErinCRichey" target="_blank">Erin Richey</a> and Kelty Ortiz.</p>
<p>And, of course, the semester-long preparation we received from Prof. <a href="http://susanemcgregor.com" target="_blank">Susan E. McGregor</a> (and the donuts halfway in!) shouldn't go unnoticed.</p>
