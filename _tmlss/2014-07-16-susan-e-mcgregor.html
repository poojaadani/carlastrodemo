  testimonial_text: "During the spring of 2012, I was fortunate to have Carl as a
    student in my class on Data Joumalism and Information Visualization at Columbia
    Journalism School. Throughout the semester, Carl proved to be a bright, dedicated
    student and valuable team partner whose enthusiasm, insight, and considerable
    skills enhanced both classroom discussions and his individual and group projects.\nUnlike
    most of his classmates, Carl arrived in my class with a fair amount of experience
    in programming and web development, having created content management systems
    for\nsmall websites for several years. Though this meant that Carl was already
    familiar with many of the concepts we discussed in class - especially during our
    programming labs -\nhe engaged fully with all of the lessons and class discussions,
    using his existing skills as a springboard to take given assignments above and
    beyond what was required, rather than using them as a crutch to skate through
    the material. This was evident most distinctly towards the end of the semester,
    when, having had to miss some weeks of school due to very significant personal
    loss, Carl not only made up his missed assignments but went beyond a simple blog
    response and executed his final critiques with a level of rigor and detail that
    would be welcome in any professional circle. He also redoubled his\ncontributions
    to his group’s final project, which was one of the class’s most sophisticated\nand
    successful.\n\nCarl's unique critical, academic and personal achievement led me
    to award him the only honor's designation among the 15 students in my class –
    a recognition that he richly deserves. He is a person whom I would gladly welcome
    as a newsroom colleague myself, and I think any organization that has the opportunity
    to work with him will quickly feel the same. \n"
