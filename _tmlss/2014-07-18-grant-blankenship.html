  testimonial_text: I've known Carl since he was arguably the brightest student in
    his university journalism program. Since then he has gone on to be the in house
    innovator everywhere he has been. Carl not only understands where digital journalism
    needs to be today, he is also thinking about where it needs to go next and how
    he can help get it there. Every newsroom needs a Carl.
