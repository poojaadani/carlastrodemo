  testimonial_text: "Carl was a colleague of mine while we were both studying at Columbia
    Journalism School in 2011-2012, and he later went on to become a professional
    mentor-of-sorts to me after he moved back to New York City, at least in terms
    of digital media. Although Carl underwent two significant profound family losses
    in just a year-and-a-half’s time – losses that would have shaken even the most
    committed of journalists and developers – he never gave up hope, spending hours
    teaching himself new skills while simultaneously balancing a slew of family obligations.
    \n\nShortly after losing his father to melanoma while we were in graduate school,
    Carl and I worked together on a project for a story I was writing for The New
    York Times, and that also was part of Columbia’s annual Innovation Showcase. Carl
    took charge of all multimedia aspects of the project, putting together an interactive
    flowchart in a matter of hours and assembling all the presentation materials to
    perfection. He put in his 100 percent in during a time in his life when most people
    wouldn’t have the fortitude to put in 50 percent. \n\nThe most notable trait that
    sets Carl apart in my mind is his genuine, intellectually-driven passion for data
    visualization and digital news that has never seemed to be motivated by the allure
    of having a “big name media” job or a byline in a national publication. While
    many of his much-less digitally-talented peers stayed in New York following graduation
    to strive after the “perfect” brand name news gig, Carl opted to honor his family
    obligations by taking a leadership position at the daily newspaper in Savannah,
    Ga., just two hours away from his mom in south Georgia so that he could visit
    her more often. I don’t know of many people with as much talent in the media industry
    as Carl who would make that kind of sacrifice. It’s a testament to his loyalty
    – a loyalty that would be an attribute for any company that has the opportunity
    to have him join their team."
