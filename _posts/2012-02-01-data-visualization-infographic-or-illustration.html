<p>Check out <a href="http://www.onlinephd.org/evolution-of-google/">this interactive graphic</a> on the rise of Google recently produced by the folks over at <a href="http://onlinephd.org">OnlinePhD.org</a>. It's an innovative example of how developers can use a responsive, single-page interface to convey a broad range of chronological information that would otherwise be crammed into a timeline. The interactivity of the graphic compels the user to click through to see what happens next, and provides a more engaging narrative than a simple linear flow would.</p>
<p>Based upon our various understandings of the terms <em>data visualization</em>, <em>infographic </em>and <em>illustration</em>, which category would this graphic fall into? I'd be most inclined to say it's an infographic rather than an illustration, given that its primary goal is to convey factual information (the chronological rise of Google) rather than just to provide an illustration, which it also does quite nicely. But I wouldn't call it a data visualization, because it's not immediately apparent from first glance what the graphic is trying to illustrate, and the story isn't data-driven. It has a more conventional narrative.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
