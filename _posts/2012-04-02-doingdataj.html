  quote-copy: The problem is that we continue to reward crap journalism that’s based
    on anecdotal evidence alone . . . But truly if it’s not a priority at the top
    to reward good data-driven journalism, it’s going to be impossible to get people
    into data because they just don’t think it’s worth it.

<p>Totally agree, but harbor the lurking suspicion that many traditional readers still like to read pretty narratives and don't care as much if the facts back them up. In other words, it's an audience problem just as much as it is an editorial one.</p>
