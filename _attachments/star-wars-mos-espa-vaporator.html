It was the home of Anakin and Shmi Skywalker and also held the famous Mos Espa Grand Arena, at which the annual Boonta Eve Classic podrace was held, and the location of Watto's shop.

    Designed around a central market place, Episode I's Mos Espa is much, much larger than Episode IV's Mos Eisley. Just outside Tozeur, Tunisia, the production crew assembled several key avenues of the marketplace, using sculpted foam and plaster around wire mesh frames to make lightweight Tatooine architecture.

    On July 28, 1997, much of the Mos Espa set was dashed apart by a furious rainstorm. Producer Rick McCallum quickly rearranged the shooting schedule to take advantage of the sets that still stood while the construction crew dilligently worked to rebuild the wreckage. This skillful troubleshooting resulted in the Tatooine sequences being finished on schedule without losing a single day.";s:17:"created_timestamp";s:10:"1272883952";s:9:"copyright";s:22:"Ulrich M?????nstermann";s:12:"focal_length";s:2:"53";s:3:"iso";s:3:"100";s:13:"shutter_speed";s:9:"0.0015625";s:5:"title";s:30:"Star Wars' Mos Espa: Vaporator";}}
